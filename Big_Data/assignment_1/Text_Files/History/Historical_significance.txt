Historiographical concept

Some would say the Ferranti MRT is "just" a clipboard with a built in
calculator, but others claim it has historical significance as "the world's
first application-specific handheld computer".

Historical significance is a historiographical key concept that explores and
seeks to explain the selection of particular social and cultural past events
for remembrance by human societies. This element of selection involved in both
ascribing and analyzing historical significance is one factor in making the
discipline of history distinct from the past.^[1] Historians consider knowledge
of dates and events within and between specific historical periods the primary
content of history, also known as "first-order knowledge" or substantive
concepts. In contrast, historical significance is an example of a subject
specific secondary key concept or "second-order knowledge" also known as a
meta-concept,^[2] or disciplinary concept,^[3] which is typically used to help
organize knowledge within a subject area, frame suitable areas of inquiry,
provide the framework upon which substantive knowledge can be built, and map
learner progression within a subject discipline.^[4] Specifically with regards
to historical significance, the way dates and events are chosen and ascribed
relative significance is not fixed and can change over time according to which
criteria were used to form the judgement of significance as well as how those
criteria were chosen themselves in the first place. This aspect to significance
has been described as:

    “a flexible relationship between us and the past”.^[5]

Historical significance is often regarded as involving judging why a particular
person or event is remembered and why another is not, it is this aspect of
reasoned and evaluative judgement about historical significance that makes
history writing differ from being simply a record of past events.^[6]

    "as soon as we turn to questions of significance—of why something happened
    versus the mere fact of its happening—history becomes an act of judgment."^
    [7]

This emphasis on exploring what has been deemed significant by certain
societies in contrast to what has been left out of the historical record has
led to historical significance often being paired with the concept of
historical silence, which looks at why and how certain social class, racial,
and/or ethnic groups have not featured in the historical record or whose
contributions have not been seen as significant at particular times, and in
particular contexts.^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11] Thus historical significance is not an
intrinsic or fixed property of a particular historical event but rather more of
an assessment of who, why, and how that event was judged significant enough to
be remembered.^[12] With this potential fluidity in mind, it therefore follows
that any assessment of historical significance should not be seen as fixed or
permanent.^[13]

    "historical significance is not an enduring or unchanging characteristic of
    any particular event. It is a contingent quality that depends on the
    perspective from which that event is subsequently viewed."^[13]

Relevance

A key concept for the study of history and public life in most societies
regardless of topic, historical significance makes judgements about what is
important to be remembered about the past and why, through its reflections on
historical aspects to contemporary culture and society^[14] including
historical reputations, events, issues,^[15] monuments,^[16] and what is chosen
to be emphasized in history writing itself.^[9] Examining what has been
included and what has been left out of the historical record can be an
effective tool for guiding students to understand how cultural background
affects their perception of history.^[17] The teaching of how to assess what
has been considered significant and what has been left out has been described
as:

    "surely a fundamental corner-stone of a liberal and democratic education
    and a pre-requisite for effective citizenship."^[18]

The relevance of historical significance can also be demonstrated by its near
ubiquitous appearance in provincial, national and international history
curriculums including, but not limited to: the Singapore National Curriculum,^[
19] the English National Curriculum,^[20] the IB Diploma History Guide,^[21]
the New Zealand National Curriculum,^[22] and the Australian National
Curriculum.^[23]

Definitions

There are many definitions of historical significance. For example, UNESCO
includes any site as a world heritage site, provided it:

    "bear[s] a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition
    or to a civilization".^[24]

Other notable examples include the following, the International Baccalaureate
Diploma History Guide which includes historical significance as one of its six
historical concepts alongside the other five: Perspectives, Change, Continuity,
Causation and Consequence. The IBO define historical significance as including:

    "the record that has been preserved through evidence or traces of the past,
    and/or the aspects that someone has consciously decided to record and
    communicate".^[21]

This definition has overlaps with that provided by the Historical Thinking
Project which includes significance as one of its six key concepts of
historical thinking:

    "A historical person or event can acquire significance if we, the
    historians, can link it to larger trends and stories that reveal something
    important for us today".^[25]

Criteria for assessing historical significance

Historical significance is typically assessed by judging an event against
pre-defined criteria and numerous criteria for assessing historical
significance have been proposed.^[12]^[26]^[27]^[28]^[29] However, these
criteria are always subjective, and therefore debatable.^[24] There can also be
important differences between what is seen as significant in terms of the
dominant national narratives of particular countries, what is taught in
schools, and how certain groups such as minority groups may see the
significance of a particular event.^[30] Thus describing any event as
historically significant or non-significant remains open to challenge.^[24]
Typically significance teaching models are not designed to be used as
checklists but rather unique disciplinary lenses or principles for examining
relative historical significance commonly attached to a historical event or
historical personage's actions.^[12] These could include different subdivisions
of significance such as: contemporary significance, causal significance,
pattern significance, symbolic significance, revelatory significance, and
present significance.^[31]
