Solution from evaporation of seawater or brine
This article is about the solution. For other uses, see Bittern
(disambiguation).

This image depicts three salt ponds adjacent to each other, ranging in color
from deep green to mustard yellow.
Bitterns can be produced from salt ponds which get their color from organisms
adapted to the hypersaline environment.^[1]

Bittern (pl. bitterns), or nigari, is the salt solution formed when halite
(table salt) precipitates from seawater or brines. Bitterns contain magnesium,
calcium, and potassium ions as well as chloride, sulfate, iodide, and other
ions.^[2]^[3]

Bittern is commonly formed in salt ponds where the evaporation of water prompts
the precipitation of halite. These salt ponds can be part of a salt-producing
industrial facility, or they can be used as a waste storage location for brines
produced in desalination processes.^[3]

Bittern is a source of many useful salts.^[3]^[4] It is used as a natural
source of Mg^2+, and it can be used as a coagulant both in the production of
tofu^[5] and in the treatment of industrial wastewater.^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]

History

Bittern has been extracted for a long time, at least several centuries. The
Dutch chemist Petrus Jacobus Kipp (1808–1864) experimented with saturated
solutions of bittern. The term for the solution is a modification of "bitter".^
[2]

Uses

Salt derivation

Bittern is a source of many salts including magnesium sulfate (epsom salt).
Multiple methods exist for removing these salts from the bittern, and the
method ultimately used depends on the target product. Products that would
naturally precipitate from the bitterns crystallize as evaporation proceeds (e.
g. kainite^[10]). Products that do not preferentially precipitate from bitterns
may precipitate through the addition of another compound or through ion
exchange.^[3]

Potassium-magnesium sulfate double salt, a good fertilizer, is a salt that
precipitates from bitterns upon addition of methanol.^[3] Ethanol is also used,
but it exhibits a preference for potassium sulfate precipitation.^[3]

The solution can furthermore be used in the production of potash and potassium
salts.^[10] Tartaric acid is one compound that can facilitate the precipitation
of these salts.^[10]

Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)[2]) can be derived from bittern.^[4] Adding an
alkaline solution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or lime will cause magnesium
hydroxide to precipitate, although lime is not as effective. Slower addition of
the alkaline solution results in the precipitation of larger particles that are
easier to remove from solution.^[4]

This is a picture of tofu on a plate surrounded by soybeans.
Bittern is one coagulant used in the production of tofu.

Coagulation

Tofu

Nigari is produced from seawater after first removing sodium chloride. It
contains mostly magnesium chloride, smaller amounts of magnesium sulfate (Epsom
salt), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and trace amounts of other
naturally occurring salts.

Nigari was the first coagulant used to make tofu in Japan.^[5] It is still used
today because tofu made using bittern preserves the original flavor of the
soybeans used to make it. Bittern causes rapid coagulation which influences the
quality of the tofu. Alternatively calcium sulfate, calcium chloride or other
substances are also used.^[5]

Wastewater treatment

Bittern can be used instead of aluminum-based coagulants in the treatment of
wastewater produced during the fabric-dyeing process.^[6] The wastewater pH is
basic, which is favorable for the use of bittern. After the addition of
bittern, precipitated magnesium hydroxide works as the coagulant to collect dye
, solids, organic matter, and heavy metals from the wastewater before settling
out of solution.^[6] The sludge produced from this wastewater treatment is also
easier to dispose of than sludge produced by aluminum-based coagulants because
there are less restrictions surrounding the disposal of magnesium, and it may
be possible to recycle the sludge as fertilizer.^[6]

Bittern can also be used as a source of magnesium ions (Mg^2+) for the
precipitation of struvite, a useful fertilizer, from wastewater containing
nitrogen and phosphorus.^[7]^[8] One source of useful wastewater is landfill
leachate.^[9] Bittern is just as good as other sources of magnesium ions at
removing phosphorus from wastewater streams, but it lags behind other magnesium
ion sources in terms of the removal of ammonia (a nitrogen compound).^[8]

Other uses

Bittern can be used to culture Haloquadratum archaea. Haloquadratum are
distinctly square-shaped and are abundant in hypersaline environments such as
salt ponds. Their cultivation is necessary for understanding both their
ecological function in those environments as well as their unique morphology.^[
11] The presence of Haloquadratum in an environment deemed inhospitable for
most life has prompted closer study of these archaea.

A study has been performed exploring the use of bittern as a natural magnesium
supplement used to decrease cholesterol spikes after a meal (postprandial
hyperlipidemia).^[12]

Due to its high salinity, bittern can also be used as a draw solution for an
osmotic process that concentrates sucrose in sugarcane juice.^[13] Because
forward osmosis is being used, the process is relatively energy-efficient.
Epsom salt can also be taken from the bittern draw solution once it is used.^[
13] This method is particularly useful in areas where sugarcane and salt
production are in close proximity to avoid costs associated with movement of
either the sugarcane juice or the bittern.^[13]

Environmental impact

In some jurisdictions, most bitterns are used for other production instead of
being directly discarded.^[14] In other jurisdictions each tonne of salt
produced can create 3+ tonnes of waste bitterns.^[15]

Although bittern generally contains the same compounds as seawater, it is much
more concentrated than seawater. If bittern is released directly into seawater,
the ensuing salinity increase may harm marine life around the point of release.
^[14] Even small increases in salinity can disrupt marine species' osmotic
balances, which may result in the death of the organism in some cases.^[16]

In December 1997, 94 corpses of green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, were found
at the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon (OLL) in Mexico, adjacent to the industrial
operation of Exportadora de Sal S.A. (ESSA), the largest saltworks in the
world. The fluoride ion F^− content in bitterns was 60.5-fold more than that in
seawater. The bitterns osmolality was 11,000 mosm/kg of water, whereas the
turtle's plasma osmolality was about 400 mosm/kg of water. Researchers
concluded that the dumping of bitterns into the ocean should be avoided.^[17]

The lack of adequate disposal methods for bitterns and concerns of local
commercial and recreational fishing associations about bitterns’ deleterious
impacts upon local fish and prawn hatchery areas led the Western Australian EPA
in 2008 to recommend against the proposed 4.2 million tonne per annum Straits
Salt project in The Pilbara region of WA. The EPA concluded that:

    ...the proposed solar salt farm is located in an area that presents
    unacceptably high risks of environmental harm to wetland values and
    unacceptable levels of uncertainty in relation to long term management of
    bitterns. [...] A high level of uncertainty in relation to the proponent’s
    ability to manage the ongoing production of over 1 million cubic metres per
    annum of bitterns C, which is toxic to marine biota and therefore likely to
    degrade wetland and biodiversity values should bitterns discharge occur
    either accidentally or be required to maintain salt farm production in the
    long term.^[18]
