Astrochemistry is the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the
universe, and their interaction with radiation.^[1] The discipline is an
overlap of astronomy and chemistry. The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to
both the Solar System and the interstellar medium. The study of the abundance
of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is
also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules
and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular
astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and
fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these
clouds that solar systems form.

History

As an offshoot of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry, the history of
astrochemistry is founded upon the shared history of the two fields. The
development of advanced observational and experimental spectroscopy has allowed
for the detection of an ever-increasing array of molecules within solar systems
and the surrounding interstellar medium. In turn, the increasing number of
chemicals discovered by advancements in spectroscopy and other technologies
have increased the size and scale of the chemical space available for
astrochemical study.

History of spectroscopy

Main articles: History of spectroscopy and Astronomical spectroscopy

Observations of solar spectra as performed by Athanasius Kircher (1646), Jan
Marek Marci (1648), Robert Boyle (1664), and Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1665)
all predated Newton's 1666 work which established the spectral nature of light
and resulted in the first spectroscope.^[2] Spectroscopy was first used as an
astronomical technique in 1802 with the experiments of William Hyde Wollaston,
who built a spectrometer to observe the spectral lines present within solar
radiation.^[3] These spectral lines were later quantified through the work of
Joseph von Fraunhofer.

Spectroscopy was first used to distinguish between different materials after
the release of Charles Wheatstone's 1835 report that the sparks given off by
different metals have distinct emission spectra.^[4] This observation was later
built upon by Léon Foucault, who demonstrated in 1849 that identical absorption
and emission lines result from the same material at different temperatures. An
equivalent statement was independently postulated by Anders Jonas Ångström in
his 1853 work Optiska Undersökningar, where it was theorized that luminous
gases emit rays of light at the same frequencies as light which they may
absorb.

This spectroscopic data began to take upon theoretical importance with Johann
Balmer's observation that the spectral lines exhibited by samples of hydrogen
followed a simple empirical relationship which came to be known as the Balmer
Series. This series, a special case of the more general Rydberg Formula
developed by Johannes Rydberg in 1888, was created to describe the spectral
lines observed for hydrogen. Rydberg's work expanded upon this formula by
allowing for the calculation of spectral lines for multiple different chemical
elements.^[5] The theoretical importance granted to these spectroscopic results
was greatly expanded upon the development of quantum mechanics, as the theory
allowed for these results to be compared to atomic and molecular emission
spectra which had been calculated a priori.

History of astrochemistry

While radio astronomy was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that
any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an
interstellar molecule^[6] – up until this point, the only chemical species
known to exist in interstellar space were atomic. These findings were confirmed
in 1940, when McKellar et al. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in
an as-of-then unidentified radio observation to CH and CN molecules in
interstellar space.^[7] In the thirty years afterwards, a small selection of
other molecules were discovered in interstellar space: the most important being
OH, discovered in 1963 and significant as a source of interstellar oxygen,^[8]
and H[2]CO (formaldehyde), discovered in 1969 and significant for being the
first observed organic, polyatomic molecule in interstellar space^[9]

The discovery of interstellar formaldehyde – and later, other molecules with
potential biological significance, such as water or carbon monoxide – is seen
by some as strong supporting evidence for abiogenetic theories of life:
specifically, theories which hold that the basic molecular components of life
came from extraterrestrial sources. This has prompted a still ongoing search
for interstellar molecules which are either of direct biological importance –
such as interstellar glycine, discovered in a comet within our solar system in
2009^[10] – or which exhibit biologically relevant properties like chirality –
an example of which (propylene oxide) was discovered in 2016^[11] – alongside
more basic astrochemical research.

Spectroscopy

Main article: Spectroscopy

One particularly important experimental tool in astrochemistry is spectroscopy
through the use of telescopes to measure the absorption and emission of light
from molecules and atoms in various environments. By comparing astronomical
observations with laboratory measurements, astrochemists can infer the
elemental abundances, chemical composition, and temperatures of stars and
interstellar clouds. This is possible because ions, atoms, and molecules have
characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain
wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However,
these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation (radio,
infrared, visible, ultraviolet etc.) able to detect only certain types of
species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules. Interstellar
formaldehyde was the first organic molecule detected in the interstellar
medium.

Perhaps the most powerful technique for detection of individual chemical
species is radio astronomy, which has resulted in the detection of over a
hundred interstellar species, including radicals and ions, and organic (i.e.
carbon-based) compounds, such as alcohols, acids, aldehydes, and ketones. One
of the most abundant interstellar molecules, and among the easiest to detect
with radio waves (due to its strong electric dipole moment), is CO (carbon
monoxide). In fact, CO is such a common interstellar molecule that it is used
to map out molecular regions.^[12] The radio observation of perhaps greatest
human interest is the claim of interstellar glycine,^[13] the simplest amino
acid, but with considerable accompanying controversy.^[14] One of the reasons
why this detection was controversial is that although radio (and some other
methods like rotational spectroscopy) are good for the identification of simple
species with large dipole moments, they are less sensitive to more complex
molecules, even something relatively small like amino acids.

Moreover, such methods are completely blind to molecules that have no dipole.
For example, by far the most common molecule in the universe is H[2] (hydrogen
gas, or chemically better said dihydrogen), but it does not have a dipole
moment, so it is invisible to radio telescopes. Moreover, such methods cannot
detect species that are not in the gas-phase. Since dense molecular clouds are
very cold (10 to 50 K [−263.1 to −223.2 °C; −441.7 to −369.7 °F]), most
molecules in them (other than dihydrogen) are frozen, i.e. solid. Instead,
dihydrogen and these other molecules are detected using other wavelengths of
light. Dihydrogen is easily detected in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible ranges
from its absorption and emission of light (the hydrogen line). Moreover, most
organic compounds absorb and emit light in the infrared (IR) so, for example,
the detection of methane in the atmosphere of Mars^[15] was achieved using an
IR ground-based telescope, NASA's 3-meter Infrared Telescope Facility atop
Mauna Kea, Hawaii. NASA's researchers use airborne IR telescope SOFIA and space
telescope Spitzer for their observations, researches and scientific operations.
^[16]^[17] Somewhat related to the recent detection of methane in the
atmosphere of Mars. Christopher Oze, of the University of Canterbury in New
Zealand and his colleagues reported, in June 2012, that measuring the ratio of
dihydrogen and methane levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of life
on Mars.^[18]^[19] According to the scientists, "...low H[2]/CH[4] ratios (less
than approximately 40) indicate that life is likely present and active."^[18]
Other scientists have recently reported methods of detecting dihydrogen and
methane in extraterrestrial atmospheres.^[20]^[21]

Infrared astronomy has also revealed that the interstellar medium contains a
suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called polyaromatic hydrocarbons,
often abbreviated PAHs or PACs. These molecules, composed primarily of fused
rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state), are said to be the
most common class of carbon compound in the Galaxy. They are also the most
common class of carbon molecule in meteorites and in cometary and asteroidal
dust (cosmic dust). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, nucleobases,
and many other compounds in meteorites, carry deuterium and isotopes of carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on Earth, attesting to their
extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar
environments (around dying, carbon-rich red giant stars).

Infrared astronomy has also been used to assess the composition of solid
materials in the interstellar medium, including silicates, kerogen-like
carbon-rich solids, and ices. This is because unlike visible light, which is
scattered or absorbed by solid particles, the IR radiation can pass through the
microscopic interstellar particles, but in the process there are absorptions at
certain wavelengths that are characteristic of the composition of the grains.^[
22] As above with radio astronomy, there are certain limitations, e.g. N[2] is
difficult to detect by either IR or radio astronomy.

Such IR observations have determined that in dense clouds (where there are
enough particles to attenuate the destructive UV radiation) thin ice layers
coat the microscopic particles, permitting some low-temperature chemistry to
occur. Since dihydrogen is by far the most abundant molecule in the universe,
the initial chemistry of these ices is determined by the chemistry of the
hydrogen. If the hydrogen is atomic, then the H atoms react with available O, C
and N atoms, producing "reduced" species like H[2]O, CH[4], and NH[3]. However,
if the hydrogen is molecular and thus not reactive, this permits the heavier
atoms to react or remain bonded together, producing CO, CO[2], CN, etc. These
mixed-molecular ices are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and cosmic rays,
which results in complex radiation-driven chemistry.^[22] Lab experiments on
the photochemistry of simple interstellar ices have produced amino acids.^[23]
The similarity between interstellar and cometary ices (as well as comparisons
of gas phase compounds) have been invoked as indicators of a connection between
interstellar and cometary chemistry. This is somewhat supported by the results
of the analysis of the organics from the comet samples returned by the Stardust
mission but the minerals also indicated a surprising contribution from
high-temperature chemistry in the solar nebula.

Research

[220px-Turbulent_border_in_Orio]
Transition from atomic to molecular gas at the border of the Orion molecular
cloud^[24]

Research is progressing on the way in which interstellar and circumstellar
molecules form and interact, e.g. by including non-trivial quantum mechanical
phenomena for synthesis pathways on interstellar particles.^[25] This research
could have a profound impact on our understanding of the suite of molecules
that were present in the molecular cloud when our solar system formed, which
contributed to the rich carbon chemistry of comets and asteroids and hence the
meteorites and interstellar dust particles which fall to the Earth by the ton
every day.

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual
chemistry, since symmetry-forbidden reactions cannot occur except on the
longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are
unstable on Earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the H[3]^+ ion.

Astrochemistry overlaps with astrophysics and nuclear physics in characterizing
the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, as well as the structure of stellar
interiors. If a star develops a largely convective envelope, dredge-up events
can occur, bringing the products of nuclear burning to the surface. If the star
is experiencing significant mass loss, the expelled material may contain
molecules whose rotational and vibrational spectral transitions can be observed
with radio and infrared telescopes. An interesting example of this is the set
of carbon stars with silicate and water-ice outer envelopes. Molecular
spectroscopy allows us to see these stars transitioning from an original
composition in which oxygen was more abundant than carbon, to a carbon star
phase where the carbon produced by helium burning is brought to the surface by
deep convection, and dramatically changes the molecular content of the stellar
wind.^[26]^[27]

In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains organic matter
("amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure") that
could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.^[28]^[29]^[30]

On August 29, 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at Copenhagen University
reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a
distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS
16293-2422, which is located 400 light years from Earth.^[31]^[32]
Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in
function to DNA. This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form
in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on
young planets early in their formation.^[33]

In September, 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are
transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more
complex organics – "a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides,
the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively".^[34]^[35] Further, as a
result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature
which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in
interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds
or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks."^[34]^[35]

In February 2014, NASA announced the creation of an improved spectral database
^[36] for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe.
According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be
associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life.
PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread
throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.^[37]

On August 11, 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the
distribution of HCN, HNC, H[2]CO, and dust inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6
(Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON).^[38]^[39]

For the study of the recourses of chemical elements and molecules in the
universe is developed the mathematical model of the molecules composition
distribution in the interstellar environment on thermodynamic potentials by
professor M.Yu. Dolomatov using methods of the probability theory, the
mathematical and physical statistics and the equilibrium thermodynamics.^[40]^[
41]^[42] Based on this model are estimated the resources of life-related
molecules, amino acids and the nitrogenous bases in the interstellar medium.
The possibility of the oil hydrocarbons molecules formation is shown. The given
calculations confirm Sokolov's and Hoyl's hypotheses about the possibility of
the oil hydrocarbons formation in Space. Results are confirmed by data of
astrophysical supervision and space researches.

In July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the Philae
lander on comet 67/P's surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy
instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the
first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and
propionaldehyde.^[43]^[44]^[45]

In December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes
of Enceladus, moon of the planet Saturn, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible
chemical essential for life^[46] as we know it, as well as other organic
molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood.
According to the researchers, "these [newly discovered] compounds could
potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic
synthesis leading to the origin of life."^[47]^[48]
