Creation of new life by other than the natural means available to an organism

Artificial reproduction is the re-creation of life brought about by means other
than natural ones. It is new life built by human plans and projects. Examples
include artificial selection, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization,
artificial womb, artificial cloning, and kinematic replication.

Artificial reproduction is one aspect of artificial life. Artificial
reproduction can be categorized into one of two classes according to its
capacity to be self-sufficient: non-assisted reproductive technology and
assisted reproductive technology.

Cutting plants' stems and placing them in compost is a form of assisted
artificial reproduction, xenobots are an example of a more autonomous type of
reproduction, while the artificial womb presented in the movie the Matrix
illustrates a non assisted hypothetical technology. The idea of artificial
reproduction has led to various technologies.

Theology

Humans have aspired to create life since immemorial times. Most theologies and
religions have conceived this possibility as exclusive of deities. Christian
religions consider the possibility of artificial reproduction, in most cases,
as heretical and sinful.

Philosophy

Although ancient Greek philosophy raised the concept that man could imitate the
creative capacity of nature, classic Greeks thought that if possible, human
beings would reproduce things as nature does, and vice versa, nature would do
the things that man does in the same way. Aristotle, for example, wrote that if
nature made tables, it would make them just as men do. In other words,
Aristotle said that if nature were to create a table, such table will look like
a human-made table. Correspondingly, Descartes envisioned the human body, and
nature, as a machine. Cartesian philosophy does not stop seeing a perfect
mirror between nature and the artificial.

However, Kant revolutionized this old idea by criticizing such naturalism. Kant
pedagogically wrote:

    "Reason, in order to be taught by nature, must approach nature with its
    principles in one hand, according to which the agreement among appearances
    can count as laws, and, in the other hand, the experiment thought out in
    accord with these principles—in order to be instructed by nature not like a
    pupil, who has recited to him whatever the teacher wants to say, but like
    an appointed judge who compels witnesses to answer the questions he puts to
    them.".

Humans are not instructed by nature but rather use nature as raw material to
invent. Humans find alternatives to the natural restrictions imposed by natural
laws thus, nature is not necessarily mirrored. In accordance with Kant (and
contrary to what Aristotle thought) Karl Marx, Alfred Whitehead,^[1] Jaques
Derrida and Juan David García Bacca noticed that nature is incapable of
reproducing tables; or airplanes, or submarines, or computers.^[2] If nature
tried to create airplanes, it would produce birds. If nature tried to create
submarines, it would get fishes. If nature tried to create computers, brains
would grow. And if nature tried to create man, modern man, monkeys will be
evolved. According to Whitehead, if we look for something natural in artificial
life, in the most elaborate cases, if anything, only atoms remain natural. Juan
David Garcia Bacca summarized,

    “It will not come out from wood, it will not be born, a galley; from clay,
    a vessel; from linen, a dress; from iron, a lever,...From natural,
    artificial. In the artificial, the natural is reduced to a simple raw
    material, even though it is perfectly specified with natural specification.
    The artificial is the real, positive, and original negation of the natural:
    of species, of genus and of essence. Thus, its ontology is superior to
    natural ontology. And for this very reason Marx did not attach any
    importance to Darwin, whose evolutionism is confined to the natural order:
    to changes, at most, from variety to variety, from species to species...
    natural. For the same reason, nature has no dialectics, even though
    continuous evolution and selection can occur. The dialectic cannot emerge
    from the natural, for deeper reasons than, using today's terms, from a
    bird, an airplane cannot emerge; from fish, a submarine; from ears, a
    telephone; from eyes, a television; from a brain, a digital computer; from
    feet, a car; from hands, an engine; from Euclid, Descartes; from Aristotle,
    Newton; from Plato, Marx.”

According to García Bacca, the major difference between natural causes and
artificial causes is that nature does not have plans and projects, while humans
design things following plans and projects.

In contrast, other influential authors such as Michael Behe have depicted the
concept and promoted the idea of intelligent design, a notion that has aroused
several doubts and heated controversies, as it reframe natural causes in
accordance with a natural plan. Previous ideas that have also provided a
positive 'sense' to natural reproduction, are orthogenesis, syntropy, orgone
and morphic resonance, among others. Although, these ideas have been
historically marginalized and often called pseudoscience, recently
Bio-semioticians are reconsidering some of them under symbolic approaches.

Current metaphysics of science actually recognizes that the artificial ways of
reproduction are diverse from nature, i.e., unnatural, anti-natural or
supernatural. Because Biosemiotics does not focus on the function of life but
on its meaning, it has a better understanding of the artificial than classic
biology.

Science

Biology, being the study of cellular life, addresses reproduction in terms of
growth and cellular division (i.e., binary fission, mitosis and meiosis);
however, the science of artificial reproduction is not restricted by the
mirroring of these natural processes.The science of artificial reproduction is
actually transcending the natural forms, and natural rules, of reproduction.
For example, xenobots have redefined the classical conception of reproduction.
Although xenobots are made of eukariotic cells they do not reproduce by
mitosis, but rather by kinematic replication. Such constructive replication
does not involve growing but rather building.

Assisted reproductive technologies

Main article: Assisted reproductive technology

Assisted reproductive technology (ART)'s purpose is to assist the development
of a human embryo, commonly because of medical concerns due to fertility
limitations.

Non-assisted reproductive technologies

Non-assisted reproductive technologies (NART) could have medical motivations
but are mostly driven by a wider heterotopic ambition. Although, NARTs are
initially designed by humans, they are programed to become independent of
humans to a relative or absolute extent. James Lovelock proposed that such
novelties could overcome humans.^[3]

Artificial cloning

Cloning is the cellular reproductive processes where two or more genetically
identical organisms are created, either by natural or artificial means.
Artificial cloning normally involves editing the genetic code, somatic cell
nuclear transfer and 3D bioprinting.

Non-assisted artificial womb

A non-assisted artificial womb or artificial uterus is a device that allow for
ectogenesis or extracorporeal pregnancy by growing an embryonic form outside
the body of an organism (that would normally carry the embryo to term) without
any human assistance. The aspect of non-assistance is the key distinction
between the current artificial womb technology (AWT) in modern medical
research, which still relies on human assistance. With this non-assisted
hypothetical technology, a zygote or stem cells are used to create an embryo
that is then incubated and monitored by artificial intelligence (AI) within a
chamber composed of biocompatible material. The AI maintains the necessary
conditions for the embryo to develop and thrive, proceeding to mimic organic
labor and childbirth in order to best help the embryo adjust to the outside
world.^[4]^[5]

Ectogenesis—gestation, depicted in the science fiction movie The Matrix, is a
fast approaching reality.^[citation needed] This type of innovation presupposes
that vertebrate wombs are not the only way for bearing humans or other similar
forms of life.^[6]

Kinematic replication

Self-replication without binary fission, meiosis, mitosis (or any other form of
cellular reproduction that involves division and growing) can be achieved.
Xenobots are an example of kinematic replication.^[7] They are biobots, named
after the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). Xenobots are cellular life
forms designed by using artificial intelligence to build more of themselves by
combining frog cells in a liquid medium.^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13]

The term kinematic replication is usually reserved for biomolecules (e.g. DNA,
RNA, prions, etc.) and artificially designed cellular forms (e.g. xenobots).

Machine constructive replication

Machine constructive replication mimics human traditional manufacturing but is
entirely self-automated. Such constructive replication is a more general form
of kinematic replication, which does not necessarily includes bio-molecular or
cellular forms. This technology also includes non-organic forms of life such as
robots, cyborgs and artificial intelligence reproduction.^[14] Constructive
replication, as kinematic replication, does not involve growing.^[15] In nature
growing is required for cellular reproduction, where a cell grows before it
splits in two daughters cells. Examples of cellular division are binary fission
, mitosis and meiosis; these natural reproductive processes require growing,
however constructive replication does not require growing but rather a
non-human subject performing the construction of more of itself by using
available raw materials.

In computational terms, constructive replication is understood as a multi-step
process which involves self-learning algorithms to assemble machines,^[16] and
it could involve machines collecting resources.^[17] Each machine is created
with a neural-network "brain" that can learn and adapt based on information it
gathers. That machine's goal is then to manufacture more of itself in the best
way it can come up with.

Such automated constructive replication involves the notion of inheritance and
learning tasks, as machines create an exact copy of themselves through a
blueprint that has been passed on to them.^[18] Each machine then learns over
time, making modifications to its software and its blueprint for future
machines' hardware. It then passes on that modified blueprint to the machines
it creates or helps create.

Consciousness amplification

Amplification of an existing consciousness is a hypothetical technology.^[19]
This idea has inspired several movies, Chappie (film) and Detroit: Become Human
.^[citation needed] The reproduction of AI is currently part of an innovative
human project,^[20] involving code and the amplification of that code. In other
terms, the reproduction could come from information the AI collected across the
Internet.
