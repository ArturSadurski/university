History

The first generation of Ameca was developed at Engineered Arts headquarters in
Falmouth, Cornwall, United Kingdom. The project started in February 2021, with
the first video revealed publicly on 1 December 2021.^[1] Ameca gained
widespread attention on Twitter^[2] and TikTok^[3] ahead of its first public

robotic family, where it could interact with visitors.^[9] In 2024, Ameca was
moved to Edinburgh in the UK to reside at the National Robotarium.^[10]

Features

It is designed as a platform for further developing robotics technologies
involving human-robot interaction.^[11] utilizes embedded microphones,
binocular eye mounted cameras, a chest camera and facial recognition software
to interact with the public. Interactions can be governed by either OpenAI's
GPT-3 or human telepresence. It also features articulated motorized arms,
fingers, neck and facial features.
