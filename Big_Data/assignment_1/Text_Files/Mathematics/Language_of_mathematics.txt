The language of mathematics or mathematical language is an extension of the
natural language (for example English) that is used in mathematics and in
science for expressing results (scientific laws, theorems, proofs, logical
deductions, etc.) with concision, precision and unambiguity.

Features

The main features of the mathematical language are the following.

  • Use of common words with a derived meaning, generally more specific and
    more precise. For example, "or" means "one, the other or both", while, in
    common language, "both" is sometimes included and sometimes not. Also, a "
    line" is straight and has zero width.
  • Use of common words with a meaning that is completely different from their
    common meaning. For example, a mathematical ring is not related to any
    other meaning of "ring". Real numbers and imaginary numbers are two sorts
    of numbers, none being more real or more imaginary than the others.
  • Use of neologisms. For example polynomial, homomorphism.
  • Use of symbols as words or phrases. For example, A = B {\displaystyle A=B} 
    {\displaystyle A=B} and ∀ x {\displaystyle \forall x} {\displaystyle \
    forall x} are respectively read as " A {\displaystyle A} {\displaystyle A}
    equals B {\displaystyle B} {\displaystyle B}" and "for all x {\displaystyle
    x} {\displaystyle x}".
  • Use of formulas as part of sentences. For example: "⁠ E = m c 2 {\
    displaystyle E=mc^{2}} {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}⁠represents quantitatively
    the mass–energy equivalence." A formula that is not included in a sentence
    is generally meaningless, since the meaning of the symbols may depend on
    the context: in "⁠ E = m c 2 {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}\,} {\displaystyle E=mc
    ^{2}\,}⁠", this is the context that specifies that E is the energy of a
    physical body, m is its mass, and c is the speed of light.
  • Use of phrases that cannot be decomposed into their components. In
    particular, adjectives do not always restrict the meaning of the
    corresponding noun, and may change the meaning completely. For example,
    most algebraic integers are not integers and integers are specific
    algebraic integers. So, an algebraic integer is not an integer that is
    algebraic.
  • Use of mathematical jargon that consists of phrases that are used for
    informal explanations or shorthands. For example, "killing" is often used
    in place of "replacing with zero", and this led to the use of assassinator
    and annihilator as technical words.

Understanding mathematical text

The consequence of these features is that a mathematical text is generally not
understandable without some prerequisite knowledge. For example, the sentence "
a free module is a module that has a basis" is perfectly correct, although it
appears only as a grammatically correct nonsense, when one does not know the
definitions of basis, module, and free module.

H. B. Williams, an electrophysiologist, wrote in 1927:

    Now mathematics is both a body of truth and a special language, a language
    more carefully defined and more highly abstracted than our ordinary medium
    of thought and expression. Also it differs from ordinary languages in this
    important particular: it is subject to rules of manipulation. Once a
    statement is cast into mathematical form it may be manipulated in
    accordance with these rules and every configuration of the symbols will
    represent facts in harmony with and dependent on those contained in the
    original statement. Now this comes very close to what we conceive the
    action of the brain structures to be in performing intellectual acts with
    the symbols of ordinary language. In a sense, therefore, the mathematician
    has been able to perfect a device through which a part of the labor of
    logical thought is carried on outside the central nervous system with only
    that supervision which is requisite to manipulate the symbols in accordance
    with the rules.^[1]^: 291
