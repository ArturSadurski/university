The first Light-Emitting Diode (LED) was created in 1927 by Russian inventor
Oleg Losev,^[1] and used silicon carbide as a semiconductor. However,
electroluminescence as a phenomenon was discovered twenty years earlier by the
English experimenter Henry Joseph Round of Marconi Labs, using the same crystal
and a cat's-whisker detector.^[2]^[3] Despite having distributed his report in
Soviet, German and British scientific journals, Losev's LED found no practical
use for several decades, partly due to the very inefficient light-producing
properties of the semiconductor used.^[4]^[5]

In 1936, Georges Destriau observed that electroluminescence could be produced
when zinc sulphide (ZnS) powder is suspended in an insulator and an alternating
electrical field is applied to it. In his publications, Destriau often referred
to luminescence as Losev-Light. Destriau worked in the laboratories of Madame
Marie Curie, also an early pioneer in the field of luminescence with research
on radium.^[6]^[7]

Hungarian Zoltán Bay together with György Szigeti patenting a lighting device
in Hungary in 1939 based on silicon carbide, with an option on boron carbide,
that emitted white, yellowish white, or greenish white depending on impurities
present.^[8] Kurt Lehovec, Carl Accardo, and Edward Jamgochian explained these
first LEDs in 1951 using an apparatus employing SiC crystals with a current
source of a battery or a pulse generator and with a comparison to a variant,
pure, crystal in 1953.^[9]^[10]

Rubin Braunstein^[11] of the Radio Corporation of America reported on infrared
emission from gallium arsenide (GaAs) and other semiconductor alloys in 1955.^[
12] Braunstein observed infrared emission generated by simple diode structures
using gallium antimonide (GaSb), GaAs, indium phosphide (InP), and
silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloys at room temperature and at 77K. In 1957,
Braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for
non-radio communication across a short distance. As noted by Kroemer^[13]
Braunstein "...had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging
from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward
current of a GaAs diode. The emitted light was detected by a PbS diode some
distance away. This signal was fed into an audio amplifier and played back by a
loudspeaker. Intercepting the beam stopped the music. We had a great deal of
fun playing with this setup."

[SNX100]

In September 1961, while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas, Texas, James
R. Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near-infrared (900 nm) light emission from
a tunnel diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate.^[14] By October 1961,
they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a
GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically isolated semiconductor
photodetector.^[15] On August 8, 1962, Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled
"Semiconductor Radiant Diode" based on their findings, which described a
zinc-diffused p–n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for
efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias.

After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks
predating submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs,
Bell Labs, and Lincoln Lab at MIT, the U.S. patent office issued the two
inventors the patent for the GaAs infrared light-emitting diode (U.S. Patent
US3293513), the first practical LED.^[14] Immediately after filing the patent,
Texas Instruments (TI) began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. In
October 1962, TI announced the first commercial LED product (the SNX-100),
which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit an 890 nm light output.^[14] In
October 1963, TI announced the first commercial hemispherical LED, the SNX-110.
^[16]

In the 1960s, several laboratories focused on LEDs that would emit visible
light. A particularly important device was demonstrated by Nick Holonyak on
October 9, 1962, while he was working for General Electric in Syracuse, New
York. The device used the semiconducting alloy gallium phosphide arsenide
(GaAsP). It was the first semiconductor laser to emit visible light, albeit at
low temperatures. At room temperature it still functioned as a red
light-emitting diode. GaAsP was the basis for the first wave of commercial LEDs
emitting visible light. It was mass-produced by the Monsanto and
Hewlett-Packard companies and used widely for displays in calculators and wrist
watches.^[17]^[18]^[19]

[220px-0603_SMD_LED]

M. George Craford,^[20] a former graduate student of Holonyak, invented the
first yellow LED and improved the brightness of red and red-orange LEDs by a
factor of ten in 1972.^[21] In 1976, T. P. Pearsall designed the first
high-brightness, high-efficiency LEDs for optical fiber telecommunications by
inventing new semiconductor materials specifically adapted to optical fiber
transmission wavelengths.^[22]

In the early 1990s, Shuji Nakamura, Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki ( Shuji
Nakamura was the one who invented it, Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki just
solved 2 of the 3 main problems in making blue LEDs )invented blue
light-emitting diodes that were dramatically more efficient than their
predecessors, bringing a new generation of bright, energy-efficient white
lighting and full-color LED displays into practical use and winning the 2014
Nobel Prize in Physics.^[23]^[24]

Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, on the order of
US$200 per unit, and so had little practical use.^[25] The first commercial
visible-wavelength LEDs used GaAsP semiconductors and were commonly used as
replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps, and in seven-segment
displays, first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test
equipment, then later in such appliances as calculators, TVs, radios,
telephones, as well as watches.^[26]

The Hewlett-Packard company (HP) was engaged in research and development (R&D)
on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968, by a research team under Howard C.
Borden, Gerald P. Pighini at HP Associates and HP Labs.^[27] During this time
HP collaborated with Monsanto Company on developing the first usable LED
products.^[28] The first usable LED products were HP's LED display and
Monsanto's LED indicator lamp, both launched in 1968.^[28]

Monsanto was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using Gallium
arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators.
^[25] Monsanto had previously offered to supply HP with GaAsP, but HP decided
to grow its own GaAsP.^[25] In February 1969, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP
Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator, the first LED device to use integrated
circuit (integrated LED circuit) technology.^[27] It was the first intelligent
LED display, and was a revolution in digital display technology, replacing the
Nixie tube and becoming the basis for later LED displays.^[29]

In the 1970s, commercially successful LED devices at less than five cents each
were produced by Fairchild Optoelectronics. These devices employed compound
semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process (developed by Jean
Hoerni,^[30]^[31] ). The combination of planar processing for chip fabrication
and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by
optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions.^[
32] LED producers have continued to use these methods as of about 2009.^[33]

The early red LEDs were bright enough for use as indicators, as the light
output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so
small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible.
Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and
equipment.

Early LEDs were packaged in metal cases similar to those of transistors, with a
glass window or lens to let the light out. Modern indicator LEDs are packed in
transparent molded plastic cases, tubular or rectangular in shape, and often
tinted to match the device color. Infrared devices may be dyed, to block
visible light. More complex packages have been adapted for efficient heat
dissipation in high-power LEDs. Surface-mounted LEDs further reduce the package
size. LEDs intended for use with fiber optics cables may be provided with an
optical connector.

Blue LED

The first blue-violet LED, using magnesium-doped gallium nitride was made at
Stanford University in 1972 by Herb Maruska and Wally Rhines, doctoral students
in materials science and engineering.^[34]^[35] At the time Maruska was on
leave from RCA Laboratories, where he collaborated with Jacques Pankove on
related work. In 1971, the year after Maruska left for Stanford, his RCA
colleagues Pankove and Ed Miller demonstrated the first blue
electroluminescence from zinc-doped gallium nitride, though the subsequent
device Pankove and Miller built, the first actual gallium nitride
light-emitting diode, emitted green light.^[36]^[37]

In 1974 the U.S. Patent Office awarded Maruska, Rhines, and Stanford professor
David Stevenson a patent for their work in 1972 (U.S. Patent US3819974 A).
Today, magnesium-doping of gallium nitride remains the basis for all commercial
blue LEDs and laser diodes. In the early 1970s, these devices were too dim for
practical use, and research into gallium nitride devices slowed.

In August 1989, Cree introduced the first commercially available blue LED,
based on the indirect bandgap semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC).^[38] SiC
LEDs had very low efficiency, no more than about 0.03%, but did emit in the
blue portion of the visible light spectrum.^[39]^[40]

In the late 1980s, key breakthroughs in GaN epitaxial growth and p-type doping^
[41] ushered in the modern era of GaN-based optoelectronic devices. Building
upon this foundation, Theodore Moustakas at Boston University patented a method
for producing high-brightness blue LEDs using a new two-step process in 1991.^[
42] In 2015, a US court ruled that three Taiwanese companies had infringed
Moustakas's prior patent, and ordered them to pay licensing fees of not less
than US$13 million.^[43]

Two years later, in 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated by Shuji
Nakamura of Nichia Corporation using a gallium nitride (GaN) growth process.^[
44]^[45]^[46] These LEDs had efficiencies of 10%.^[47] In parallel, Isamu
Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University were working on developing the
important GaN deposition on sapphire substrates and the demonstration of p-type
doping of GaN. This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making
high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of
technologies like Blu-ray.^[48]^[49]

Nakamura was awarded the 2006 Millennium Technology Prize for his invention.^[
50] Nakamura, Hiroshi Amano, and Isamu Akasaki were awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 2014 for "the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes,
which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources."^[24]

In 1995, Alberto Barbieri at the Cardiff University Laboratory (GB)
investigated the efficiency and reliability of high-brightness LEDs and
demonstrated a "transparent contact" LED using indium tin oxide (ITO) on
(AlGaInP/GaAs).

In 2001^[51] and 2002,^[52] processes for growing gallium nitride (GaN) LEDs on
silicon were successfully demonstrated. In January 2012, Osram demonstrated
high-power InGaN LEDs grown on silicon substrates commercially,^[53] and
GaN-on-silicon LEDs are in production at Plessey Semiconductors. As of 2017,
some manufacturers are using SiC as the substrate for LED production, but
sapphire is more common, as it has the most similar properties to that of
gallium nitride, reducing the need for patterning the sapphire wafer (patterned
wafers are known as epi wafers). Samsung, the University of Cambridge, and
Toshiba are performing research into GaN on Si LEDs.

Toshiba has stopped research, possibly due to low yields.^[54]^[55]^[56]^[57]^[
58]^[59]^[60] Some opt for epitaxy, which is difficult on silicon, while
others, like the University of Cambridge, choose a multi-layer structure, in
order to reduce (crystal) lattice mismatch and different thermal expansion
ratios, to avoid cracking of the LED chip at high temperatures (e.g. during
manufacturing), reduce heat generation and increase luminous efficiency.
Sapphire substrate patterning can be carried out with nanoimprint lithography.^
[61]^[62]^[63]^[64]^[65]^[66]^[67]

GaN-on-Si is difficult but desirable since it takes advantage of existing
semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. It allows for the wafer-level
packaging of LED dies resulting in extremely small LED packages.^[68]

GaN is often deposited using metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOCVD),^[69]
and it also uses lift-off.

White LEDs and the illumination breakthrough

Even though white light can be created using individual red, green and blue
LEDs, this results in poor color rendering, since only three narrow bands of
wavelengths of light are being emitted. The attainment of high efficiency blue
LEDs was quickly followed by the development of the first white LED. In this
device a Y^
[3]Al^
[5]O^
[12]:Ce (known as "YAG" or Ce:YAG phosphor) cerium-doped phosphor coating
produces yellow light through fluorescence. The combination of that yellow with
remaining blue light appears white to the eye. Using different phosphors
produces green and red light through fluorescence. The resulting mixture of
red, green and blue is perceived as white light, with improved color rendering
compared to wavelengths from the blue LED/YAG phosphor combination.^[70]

[220px-Haitz-law]
Illustration of Haitz's law, showing improvement in light output per LED over
time, with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis

The first white LEDs were expensive and inefficient. The light output then
increased exponentially. The latest research and development has been
propagated by Japanese manufacturers such as Panasonic and Nichia, and by
Korean and Chinese manufacturers such as Samsung, Solstice, Kingsun, Hoyol and
others. This trend in increased output has been called Haitz's law after Roland
Haitz.^[71]^[72]

Light output and efficiency of blue and near-ultraviolet LEDs rose and the cost
of reliable devices fell. This led to relatively high-power white-light LEDs
for illumination, which are replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting.^[
73]^[74]

Experimental white LEDs were demonstrated in 2014 to produce 303 lumens per
watt of electricity (lm/W); some can last up to 100,000 hours.^[75]^[76]
Commercially available LEDs have an efficiency of up to 223 lm/W as of 2018.^[
77]^[78]^[79] A previous record of 135 lm/W was achieved by Nichia in 2010.^[80
] Compared to incandescent bulbs, this is a huge increase in electrical
efficiency, and even though LEDs are more expensive to purchase, overall
lifetime cost is significantly cheaper than that of incandescent bulbs.^[81]

The LED chip is encapsulated inside a small, plastic, white mold^[82]^[83]
although sometimes an LED package can incorporate a reflector.^[84] It can be
encapsulated using resin (polyurethane-based), silicone,^[85]^[86]^[87] or
epoxy^[88] containing (powdered) Cerium-doped YAG phosphor particles.^[89] The
viscosity of phosphor-silicon mixtures must be carefully controlled.^[89] After
application of a phosphor-silicon mixture on the LED using techniques such as
jet dispensing,^[90] and allowing the solvents to evaporate, the LEDs are often
tested, and placed on tapes for SMT placement equipment for use in LED light
bulb production. Some "remote phosphor" LED light bulbs use a single plastic
cover with YAG phosphor for one^[91] or several blue LEDs, instead of using
phosphor coatings on single-chip white LEDs.^[92] Ce:YAG phosphors and epoxy in
LEDs^[93] can degrade with use, and is more apparent with higher concentrations
of Ce:YAG in phosphor-silicone mixtures, because the Ce:YAG decomposes with
use.^[94]^[95]^[96]

The output of LEDs can shift to yellow over time due to degradation of the
silicone.^[86] There are several variants of Ce:YAG, and manufacturers in many
cases do not reveal the exact composition of their Ce:YAG offerings.^[97]
Several other phosphors are available for phosphor-converted LEDs to produce
several colors such as red, which uses nitrosilicate phosphors,^[98]^[99] and
many other kinds of phosphor materials exist for LEDs such as phosphors based
on oxides, oxynitrides, oxyhalides, halides, nitrides, sulfides, quantum dots,
and inorganic-organic hybrid semiconductors. A single LED can have several
phosphors at the same time.^[90]^[100] Some LEDs use phosphors made of
glass-ceramic or composite phosphor/glass materials.^[101]^[102] Alternatively,
the LED chips themselves can be coated with a thin coating of
phosphor-containing material, called a conformal coating.^[103]^[104]

The temperature of the phosphor during operation and how it is applied limits
the size of an LED die. Wafer-level packaged white LEDs allow for extremely
small LEDs.^[68]

Polychromatic

In 2024, QPixel introduced as polychromatic LED that could replace the
3-subpixel model for digital displays. The technology uses a gallium nitride
semiconductor that emits light of different frequencies modulated by voltage
changes. A prototype display achieved a resolution of 6,800 PPI or 3k x 1.5k
pixels.^[105]
