A quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarator is a type of stellarator (a magnetic
confinement fusion reactor) that satisfies the property of omnigeneity, avoids
the potentially hazardous toroidal bootstrap current, and has minimal
neoclassical transport in the collisionless regime.^[1]

Wendelstein 7-X, the largest stellarator in the world, was designed to be
roughly quasi-isodynamic (QI).

In contrast to quasi-symmetric fields,^[2] exactly QI fields on flux surfaces
cannot be expressed analytically.^[3] However, it has been shown that
nearly-exact QI can be extremely well approximated through mathematical
optimization,^[4] and that the resulting fields enjoy the aforementioned
properties.

In a QI field, level curves of the magnetic field strength B {\displaystyle B} 
{\displaystyle B} on a flux surface close poloidally (the short way around the
torus), and not toroidally (the long way around), causing the stellarator to
resemble a series of linked magnetic mirrors.
