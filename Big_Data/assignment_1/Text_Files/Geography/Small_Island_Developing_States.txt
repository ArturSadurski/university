Map of the Small Island Developing States

The Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are a grouping of developing
countries which are small island countries and small states that tend to share
similar sustainable development challenges. These include small but growing
populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to natural disasters
, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on international trade
, and fragile environments. Their growth and development are also held back by
high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international
transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and
infrastructure due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create
economies of scale. They consist of some of the most vulnerable countries to
anthropogenic climate change.

The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at
the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992. The
Barbados Programme of Action was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their
sustainable development efforts. The United Nations Office of the High
Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing
Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) represents the group
of states.^[1]

List of SIDS

As of 2023, the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least
Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island
Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) lists 57 such nations (39 sovereign states and 18
dependent territories).^[2] These nations are grouped into three geographical
regions: the Caribbean;^[3] the Pacific;^[4] and Africa, Indian Ocean,
Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS),^[5] including 18 Associate Members of
the United Nations Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional
cooperation body: the Caribbean Community, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the
Indian Ocean Commission respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate
members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the Alliance of
Small Island States (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions
for the SIDS within the United Nations System.

Impacts of climate change

Main article: Effects of climate change on small island countries

[350px-2014_Small_Island_Developing_States_meetin]
3rd International Conference on Small Island Developing States, Samoa,
September 2014

The SIDS are some of the regions most vulnerable to anthropogenic climate
change. Due to their oceanic environment, SIDS are especially vulnerable to the
marine effects of climate change like sea level rise, ocean acidification,
marine heatwaves, and the increase in cyclone intensity. Changing precipitation
patterns could also cause droughts. Many citizens of SIDS live near a
coastline, meaning that they have a high risk exposure to the effects of marine
climate change. Additional climate change vulnerability comes through their
economies: many SIDS have economies that are based on natural resources, such
as ecotourism, fishing, or agriculture. Phenomena like sea level rise, coastal
erosion, and severe storms have the potential to severely impact their
economies.^[7]

In addition to these vulnerabilities, the energy sector in SIDS faces unique
challenges and opportunities, particularly in the least-electrified regions.
According to the March 2024 IRENA report, "Small Island Developing States at a
Crossroads: Towards Equitable Energy Access in Least-Electrified Countries,"
these states, which contribute less than 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions,
are exploring decentralized renewable energy solutions to address their energy
access issues. Technologies such as biomass gasification, small-scale hydro,
and solar PV not only offer paths to reduce their carbon footprint but also
enhance resilience against climate impacts. The report highlights case studies
from Guinea-Bissau, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu, showing significant
socio-economic benefits from improved energy access, including increased income
opportunities for rural women and reduced indoor air pollution. These
advancements are crucial as they not only provide immediate relief but also
contribute to long-term sustainability and resilience against future climate
challenges."^[8]

Sustainable Development Goals

Small island development states are mentioned in several of the Sustainable
Development Goals.^[9] For example, Target 7 of Sustainable Development Goal 14
("Life below Water") states: "By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small
island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use
of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries,
aquaculture and tourism".^[10]

    though they are not island countries. This may be because they are
    low-lying coastal countries whose economies are dependent on a small number
    of activities. Their classification as SIDS is controversial.^[6]
