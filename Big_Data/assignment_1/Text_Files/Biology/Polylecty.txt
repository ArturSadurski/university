Term in pollination ecology

A Bombus terrestris collects nectar
Bombus terrestris, an opportunistic generalist, collecting pollen.

The term polylecty or generalist is used in pollination ecology to refer to
bees that collect pollen from a range of unrelated plants.^[1]^[2] Honey bees
exemplify this behavior, collecting nectar from a wide array of flowers. Other
predominantly polylectic genera include Bombus,^[3] Ceratina^[4]^[better source

needed]. The opposite term is oligolecty, and refers to bees that exhibit a
narrow, specialized preference for pollen sources, typically to a single family
or genus of flowering plants.

Roughly two-thirds of bee species in Europe are polylectic, relying on a
diverse array of pollen sources.^[7] This broad foraging approach allows these
generalist bees to thrive in various environments and quickly adjust to
shifting conditions. However, despite their adaptability, they are less
efficient pollen gatherers than oligolectic bees, whose morphology is often
specialized for more effective pollen collection from a narrower range of
plants.^[8]^[better source needed]

A species that exhibits polylecty is known as polylectic. This term should not
be confused with Polylectic as a grammatical term, which has a similar
etymology to the biological definition but instead refers to the adjective of a
multi-word term, as opposed to a monolectic which is the adjective for a
one-word term.^[9]
