Astrostatistics is a discipline which spans astrophysics, statistical analysis
and data mining.^[1] It is used to process the vast amount of data produced by
automated scanning of the cosmos, to characterize complex datasets, and to link
astronomical data to astrophysical theory. Many branches of statistics are
involved in astronomical analysis including nonparametrics, multivariate
regression and multivariate classification, time series analysis, and
especially Bayesian inference. The field is closely related to astroinformatics
.
